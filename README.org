This repository contains example implementations for basic data structures, like
~linked lists~, ~tries~, ~trees~, etc.

Each data structure will be implemented in it's own module which can contain
multiple different implementations for comparision. For details about the data
structure, the implementation and other related information about the
implementation (e.g. sources I used) please see the individual =README.org= of
the module folders for the corresponding data structure.

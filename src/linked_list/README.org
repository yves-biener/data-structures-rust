For the implementations for linked lists I used this [[https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/first-layout.html][Book]]. The Book itself has
good content but the mixture between beginner, intermediate (and sometimes even
expert) levels of details makes it pretty annoying to read. Otherwise is the
information and the content it contains very useful and helpful for the
implementation of ~linked lists~.
